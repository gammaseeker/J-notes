Upon completing my Systems Programming I & II courses (CSE 220 and CSE 320 at Stony Brook University respectively) this past academic year I have learned that I actually enjoy this field.
Although these two courses are notoriously known as the "hardest courses" in the entire major, with half decent time management skills, I felt that they were not as bad as people make it seem. 
But, I would be lying if there weren't parts of the courses that I absolutely dreaded (ALUs).
These two courses have inspired me to continue my education in systems programming which is why I started building my own operating system: OculuS.
I will be following the Bare Bones tutorial on OSDev https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones

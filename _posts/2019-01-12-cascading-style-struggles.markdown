I think most people struggle to understand CSS, including me. It has been three years since my web development class in junior year of high school where I first learned CSS, and admittedly that’s where my skills with that language peaked. Without constant practice, the technology slowly turns from a science to magic. This is something that I am determined to change about myself. To the common populace, people do not really care or understand complex backend operations, but they can definitely identify when a website looks “aesthetic.” I want to take you along with me on my quest to conquer CSS.

Recently, I’ve been working on a todo list application that I call ToDoThis. Here is the current status of the website:
![todo-current]({{site.url}}/{{sitebaseurl}}/assets/img/todo-current.png)<br>
Not very impressive style-wise, but it gets the job done like any todo list app. It creates items on the list, and you can delete them when you’ve finished them. The improvement I want to make to the frontend of my application is this:
![todo-wireframe]({{site.url}}/{{sitebaseurl}}/assets/img/todo-wireframe.png)<br>
